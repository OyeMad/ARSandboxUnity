# ARSandboxUnity
ARSandboxUnity is a software for operating an augmented reality sandbox like  [SARndbox](http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/) developped by UC Davis. 
As Kinect v1 and Kinect v2 has stopped production, I choose Intel RealSense D415 instead. Besides, I will port the [SARndbox](https://github.com/KeckCAVES/SARndbox) project to the Unity platform, and refactor its framework better for future sandbox-based games and applications.
